                    GlootDo is a teardrop trailer maker made as a team project
                    for a object-oriented software engineering class. Prior to
                    this project, I had never worked with Java. As a result, I
                    had to adapt and learn more and more during the semester.
                    Since it was the first project I did that had such a large
                    extent, I also learned to plan and organize my work as a
                    team. Learn more about the project by watching the short

                    On the 15th and 16th of March, I participated with 2 other
                    friends in the Coveo Blitz 2022, a 24 hours challenge. We
                    were presented a particular game that had precise rules and
                    had to make a bot that would be the best at this game. This
                    bot would be confronted to other teams' bots and, at the end
                    of the 24 hours, a tournament was scheduled. To complete
                    this task, we used Python and could test our bot locally
                    using the provided Docker setup. In the end, we managed to
                    go to the 3rd round (which means we were in the top 8 out of
                    32 teams). This hackathon made me realize how important good
                    and clean code can be, even when the time is very limited.

                    During the 2021/2022 winter break, I decided to try
                    web-developpement for the first time. Having never worked
                    with HTML, CSS or Javascript before, I had a lot to learn.
                    Through a week of reading and work, I managed to learn a lot
                    about all of these 3 and even managed to produce the website
                    on which you are reading this text. Since I am taking a
                    web-developpement course in the winter 2022 semester, the
                    skills I acquired will be further practiced. I will also
                    learn more about web-developpement architecture, frameworks
                    (e.g. Vue.js), RESTful API and many other things.

                        During the 2021 summer semester, I worked as a research
                        intern at Université Laval. I was part of the DEEL
                        project and was under the supervision of François
                        Laviolette, PhD. I primarily worked on deep neural
                        networks explainability. Among other things, I worked
                        with ensemble methods and how to explain them concretely
                        using partial orders and Hasse diagrams (see picture).
                        Having never worked on machine learning prior to this
                        internship, I had to challenge myself and had to learn a
                        lot in a short period of time. I developped my skills in
                        Python, e.g. with the Scikit-Learn library, and learned
                        to use the Pytorch library.
